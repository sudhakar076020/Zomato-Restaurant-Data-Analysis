## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

The following analyses were performed:

- Rating distribution analysis  
- Price range vs rating comparison  
- Votes vs rating analysis  
- Online delivery distribution  
- Cost for two analysis  
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features  
- Top 10 most voted restaurants  
- Cuisine distribution

## 🗄 SQL Analysis

SQL queries were written to:

- Calculate average rating by price range  
- Identify top voted restaurants  
- Analyze online delivery distribution  
- Perform grouped aggregations  

This demonstrates practical data querying and business analysis skills.

## 📈 Key Business Insights

- Most restaurants have ratings between **3.0 and 4.0**, indicating moderate customer satisfaction.  
- Higher price range does not necessarily guarantee higher ratings.  
- Restaurants with higher vote counts tend to have slightly better ratings.  
- Weak correlation between numerical features suggests ratings depend on multiple qualitative factors.
